# AngularJS Directives and UI Bootstrap (Modals)	
###### Coding training session. Boston 2017
---

## What are Directives?
  - Directives are everywhere! (ng-app, ng-if, np-repeat, etc..)
  - Simply used to extend HTML
  - “invent new HTML syntax, specific to your application.”

## Why use Directives?
  - Don’t repeat code; create more reusable code
  - More declarative HTML markup
  - Easy to test when thought of as smaller components



## UI Bootstrap - Modal
  - Bootstrap components written in pure AngularJS by the AngularUI Team
  - Saves time by using these already styled and built *DIRECTIVES*
  - Data can be passed in through RESOLVE property, result of modal is passed back to calling parent in MODAL INSTANCE(shown in demo)



## Run app simply with http-server
   - Open terminal and CD to project
   - Run `npm install`
   - Run `http-server`
   - Open on in Browser with port specified in terminal outcome
